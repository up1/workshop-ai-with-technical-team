## List of prompt to generate code
* REST API
* Working with database
* Refactoring code
* Explain code
* Testing
  * Design test case
  * Write unit test and api test
* Deployment with Docker

### Step 1 
```
Role Golang developer,
I want to generate RESTful API with Go and Gin framework from my requirement from below

"""
Create a new user
* first name
* last name
* age


POST /users
Request body
{
    "first_name": "somkiat",
    "last_name": "pui",
    "age": 40
}

Response for API

200 => success
{
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "Somkiat",
    "last_name": "Pui",
    "age": 40
}

409 => First name is duplicated
{
    "message": "First name is duplicated"
}

500 => Internal server error
{
    "message": "Internal server error"
}
"""

```

Try to run
```
$go run main.go

$go test -coverprofile=coverage.out
$go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Step 2 :: More tasks
* Refactor main to demo package
* generate api test with go and gin
* Generate code to insert a new user in MySQL database
* Refactor code :: try to move code from controller to service layer
* In database layer or repository layer, try to generate code to check for duplicate first name in the database
* Refactor code, move code from main() function to Controller layer, eg. UserController
* Generate table scheman and diagram
  * Try to generate database diagram of user table in markdown format
  * Try to generate database diagram of user table in DBML format
  * Try to generate sql query to create table user

### Step 3 :: Testing

* As a Tester/QA to test software, i want to generate test cases for REST API 
  - success case
  - failure case
  - edge case
* As a Tester/QA to test software, i want to generate test cases for REST API with table format (markdown) 
  - success case
  - failure case
  - edge case

* As a Go developer, i want to generate API test with testing package and testify package
  - success case
  - failure case
  - edge case

## Step 4 :: Deployment step
* As a operation, i want to deploy REST API with Docker and Docker compose, pls generate file from below
  - Dockerfile for go application
  - Dockerfile for mysql with initial table and data for testing
  - docker-compose.yml of Go and mysql

* Please use go 1.24 and mysql 8
* Try to add heakcheck og go and mysql to docker-compose.yml 
* Update depends_on with healthy status
* Try to add observability to REST API
  - Application metric with prometheus
  - Log aggregation with log/slog package
  - Distributed tracing with opentelemetry and export to jaeger tracing
